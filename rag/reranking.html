      <h1>Re-ranking in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems</h1>

      <section id="overview">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strengthens large language models (LLMs) by grounding them in external knowledge.
          A key challenge arises in the <em>retrieval stage</em>, where noisy or partially relevant documents can degrade performance.
          Re-ranking addresses this issue by re-scoring retrieved documents and ensuring that only the most relevant ones are passed
          to the generator.

        <h2>Cross-Encoder Based Re-ranking</h2>
        <p>
          Cross-encoder models such as <strong>ColBERT</strong> and <strong>ColBERTv2</strong> jointly encode query-document pairs,
          allowing fine-grained token-level interactions. This significantly improves relevance scoring compared to bi-encoders,
          which embed queries and documents separately. While effective, cross-encoders are computationally heavy and introduce
          higher latency, making them less suitable for real-time or large-scale applications.

      <section id="llm-based">
        <h2>LLM-based Re-ranking</h2>
        <p>
          Instruction-tuned LLMs can also serve as re-rankers. Approaches like <strong>RankGPT</strong> frame re-ranking as a ranking
          or classification prompt, enabling zero-shot or few-shot usage. These methods are flexible and accurate, but querying an
          LLM for every candidate passage is costly. To reduce expense, distillation techniques are used, where LLM outputs train
          smaller cross-encoders for efficient deployment.

        <h2>API-based Solutions</h2>
        <p>
          Services such as <strong>Cohere Rerank</strong> provide fast, production-ready re-ranking APIs. These tools simplify integration
          into RAG pipelines and are optimized for speed. However, they introduce reliance on third-party providers and recurring costs,
          which may limit scalability for large deployments.

        <h2>Discussion</h2>
        <p>
          Re-ranking consistently enhances RAG pipelines by filtering out irrelevant results and ensuring the generator receives high-quality context.
          Different methods involve trade-offs:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Cross-encoders:</strong> Accurate but slow and resource-intensive.</li>
          <li><strong>LLM-based re-ranking:</strong> Flexible and accurate, but costly at scale.</li>
          <li><strong>API-based solutions:</strong> Easy to use and fast, but dependent on external vendors.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The best strategy depends on an applicationâ€™s accuracy needs, budget, and latency requirements.
